# Tesla-vs-Ferrari-Stock-Price
Welcome to the **Tesla vs Ferrari Stock Price Analysis** project! ðŸš—ðŸ’¥

# Introduction

In this project, we dive deep into the stock performance of **Tesla** and **Ferrari** over a period spanning from **2015 to 2023**. Both companies are giants in the automotive industry, but how do their stock prices compare over time? Are there patterns or correlations that investors could leverage?

Through detailed **SQL analysis**, we explore key financial metrics to answer these questions and more:

### Key Metrics Analyzed:
- **Moving Averages**: Track the long-term trends in stock prices to understand the big picture.
- **Volatility**: Measure the daily fluctuations to gauge the risk involved in trading these stocks.
- **Price Differences**: Compare the performance of Tesla and Ferrari on a daily basis.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Find out if thereâ€™s a link between the two stocksâ€™ movements over the years.
- **Price Momentum**: Understand short-term changes by looking at the day-to-day shifts in stock prices.
- **Cumulative Returns**: See how much an initial investment in each stock would have grown over the years.

By using **SQL queries**, we've extracted and analyzed a massive set of data to help answer these questions. This project is not only a great exercise in data analysis but also offers a practical way to assess the financial health and stock market behavior of two iconic brands.

Following are the queries:-
